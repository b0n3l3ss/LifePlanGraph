# LifePlanGraph
The premis of this project is to show what your life looks like in relation to the important people in your life.  The graph will be the users age vs the year.  You will be able to input your birth year, rooting the graph around that date.  The rest of of the inputs will be the birth years and names of the people that are important to you.  The resulting graph will include lines for your own life and lines for those important people.  This tool is to primarily show you by when you want certain special life events to start.  For example, if you want to start having kids at 30, you would presumably have a kid around a year later, meaning, that you can roughly expect that child to be graduating high school around when you are 50 or so.

This project is going to be starting with a minimal viable project as described below: 

Necessary Inputs: User’s name and year of birth

Output: Graph with user’s year of birth and age at birth (0 years old) as origin.  Graph will have the date year x-axis and age in years as the y-axis.  Furthermore, the graph will have a straight line with slope 1 and x-intercept at the origin (the birth year of the user).

Features:

Add other non-root members to the graph.  Graph should be parallel,but have a different x intercept as they are most likely to be born in a different year as the root person.
Additional lines should also have the name of the additional people added to the graph

Button to invert axis.  This should essentially flip everything x = y
